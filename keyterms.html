</FONT> 
<BR>
<p> Protons are tiny subatomic particles with a positive electrical charge that, along with neutrons, form the nucleus of an atom. <BR>
The heavier the atom, the more protons (and neutrons) it contains. Hydrogen, which is the lightest element, has a nucleus made from a single proton. 
The heaviest element in the Periodic Table, which is Oganesson, has 118 protons. They are denoted by symbol + or positive.

<FONT COLOR="BLUE" SIZE="40" FACE="SEGEO SCRIPT" <B> Electron </B> 
</FONT> 
<BR>
<p> Electron is the negatively charged electrons circle an atomâ€™s central nucleus. Like opposite ends of a magnet that attract one another, 
the negative electrons are attracted to a positive force, which binds them to the nucleus. The nucleus is small and dense compared with the electrons, 
which are the lightest charged particles in nature. The electrons circle the nucleus in orbital paths called shells, each of which holds only a 
certain number of electrons. They are denoted by symbol - or negative.

<FONT COLOR="BLUE" SIZE="40" FACE="SEGEO SCRIPT" <B> Neutron </B> 
</FONT> 
<BR>
<p> Neutron, neutral subatomic particle that, in conjunction with protons, makes up the nucleus of every atom except ordinary hydrogen 
(whose nucleus has one proton and no neutrons). They are usually denoted by the symbol n or no. Neutrons do not have any net electric 
charge associated with them. They do, however, have a mass which is slightly greater in magnitude than that of a proton.

<p> An atom is the basic building block of matter that cannot be divided into smaller parts using any chemical means. It consists of a nucleus, 
which is made up of protons and neutrons and is surrounded by orbiting electrons. It is the fundamental unit of matter and it forms various 
elements, ions, compound, and biomolecules essential to life.
