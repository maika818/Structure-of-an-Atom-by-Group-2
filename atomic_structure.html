<h1>How Atomic Structure works</h1>

<BR>
<p> Atomic structure works by organizing protons, neutrons, and electrons within an atom. The nucleus, which contains positively charged protons 
and neutral neutrons, forms the atom's dense core. Electrons, which are negatively charged, orbit the nucleus in specific energy levels or shells. 
These energy levels are filled in a way that minimizes the atom's energy, with electrons occupying lower energy levels before filling higher ones. 
The arrangement of these electrons determines the atomâ€™s chemical behavior and bonding properties. Atoms strive to achieve stable electron configurations, 
often resulting in chemical bonds with other atoms. Quantum mechanics further refines this by describing electron positions in terms of probabilistic 
orbitals rather than fixed paths, explaining how electrons are distributed around the nucleus. These orbitals have different shapes and energy levels, 
reflecting the likelihood of finding electrons in various regions. The interactions between these electrons and the nucleus govern the formation of molecules 
and the physical properties of substances. Thus, atomic structure is fundamental in understanding the behavior of elements and their compounds in both chemical reactions and material science.
The number of protons in the nucleus determines which element an atom is, while the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus determines which 
kind of reactions the atom will undergo.
